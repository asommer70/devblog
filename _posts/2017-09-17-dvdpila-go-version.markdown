## Oldies are Goldies

Seems like every time I set out to learn a new language, framework, etc I end up rebuilding [DVD Pila!](http://dvdpila.thehoick.com/).  It's worked out because the modeling is simple as far as the database goes.

Also, there's not too much JavaScript on the front-end.  Though the very first version of DVD Pila! was developed as a single-page-app using EmberJS.  

In versions since the JavaScript/CoffeeScript has been limited to manipulating video playback and AJAX calls to update playback time for videos.

## Why Another Rewrite?

The last rewrite of **DVD Pila!** was a Node + Express + MongoDB web app.  The backend also used Mongoose for some more ORM type functionality.

This time around I'm going to develop the app using [Go](https://golang.org/).

I started learning Go because in my day job there's a need to fetch a bunch of data from an external API.  To get one *"object"* from the API needs 3 - 4 AJAX calls which causes the script to take forever to complete.

The Go language has great [concurrency features](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10), or at least it makes it easy to fumble your way through getting the process of multi-process.

## Let's Go

Come along with me on this wonderous journey of self discovery and enlightenment.  Or maybe it'll be a big hairy mess full of fumbling and disappointment...

Time will tell, but so far learning Go has been a lot of fun.  Developing web apps in Go is a little confusing for me at the moment, but it may also be simply the new language and all that.

Party On!
