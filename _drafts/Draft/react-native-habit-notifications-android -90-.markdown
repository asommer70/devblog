# React Native Habit Notifications Android

## Reminders on Android

Getting reminder notifications on iOS for the [Habit](https://github.com/asommer70/thehoick-habit-app) app was more complicated than I thought, but learning some Objective-C and contributing to another Open Source project was fun.  Always fun to learn new things.

Now it's time to create another platform specific component for Android reminders.

## React Native System Notification

Like the iOS npm package for React Native CalendarReminders there is a package providing similar functionality for Android.  The package is [React Native System Notification](https://github.com/Neson/react-native-system-notification), and going by the README the source code won't have to be updated to add recurring notification functionality.

Though contributing to a React Native Android module would be very coolâ€¦
