## FIRE!!!

When I hear the word FIRE (all caps necessary) I always think of Captain Kirk at the end of Undiscovered Country:

And it's now time to make our hero ship fire it's own weapons.  In this case we'll start with lasers and go from there.  Thinking to have some type of bomb/missile to add a little extra kick to our plucky hero.

Plucky, ya definitely plucky!

## Adding the Sprite

In this case the sprite is borrowed again from [Cave Berries](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=1834).  Except the color is going to be changed up to green and dark_green.
